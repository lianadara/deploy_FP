```python

def analyze_data(dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze the data, using the provided dataframes (`dfs`).
    1. Prepare: Preprocessing and cleaning data if necessary
    2. Process: Manipulating data for analysis (grouping, filtering, aggregating, etc.)
    3. Analyze: Conducting the actual analysis (if the user asks to plot a chart you must save it as an image in temp_chart.png and not show the chart.)
    If the user requests to create a chart, utilize the Python matplotlib library to generate high-quality graphics that will be saved directly to a file.
    At the end, return a dictionary of:
    - type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot")
    - value (can be a string, a dataframe or the path of the plot, NOT a dictionary)

In the answer, you must never write the "technical" names of the tables.

2024-06-11 18:25:12 [INFO] Question: 
    Here are the descriptions of the columns in the dataset:
    - `branch_name`: The name of the hospital branch where the data was recorded. This helps identify which branch the data pertains to.
    - `month`: The month in which the data was collected. It is usually represented as a numeric value (e.g., 1 for January, 2 for February, etc.).
    - `year`: The year in which the data was recorded. This helps to identify the time period of the data.
    - `jumlah_pasien`: The total number of patients treated in the branch during the specified month and year.
    - `avg_review`: The average review score given by patients for their experience at the branch. This is typically on a scale (e.g., 1 to 5), where higher scores indicate better reviews.
    - `cogs`: Cost of Goods Sold. This refers to the direct costs attributable to the production of the services provided by the hospital, such as medical supplies and labor directly associated with patient care.
    - `total_revenue`: The total revenue generated by the branch during the specified month and year. This includes all income from patient services and other activities.
    - `total_profit`: The total profit made by the branch during the specified month and year. This is calculated as total revenue minus cogs.
    - `score`: This column represents a composite score calculated to evaluate the performance of the hospital branch. It is calculated using the following formula:
    score = (jumlah_pasien * 0.2) + (total_profit * 0.45) + (avg_review * 0.35)
    

Query: how many branch?

    Here are the descriptions of the columns in the dataset:
    - `branch_name`: The name of the hospital branch where the data was recorded. This helps identify which branch the data pertains to.
    - `month`: The month in which the data was collected. It is usually represented as a numeric value (e.g., 1 for January, 2 for February, etc.).
    - `year`: The year in which the data was recorded. This helps to identify the time period of the data.
    - `jumlah_pasien`: The total number of patients treated in the branch during the specified month and year.
    - `avg_review`: The average review score given by patients for their experience at the branch. This is typically on a scale (e.g., 1 to 5), where higher scores indicate better reviews.
    - `cogs`: Cost of Goods Sold. This refers to the direct costs attributable to the production of the services provided by the hospital, such as medical supplies and labor directly associated with patient care.
    - `total_revenue`: The total revenue generated by the branch during the specified month and year. This includes all income from patient services and other activities.
    - `total_profit`: The total profit made by the branch during the specified month and year. This is calculated as total revenue minus cogs.
    - `score`: This column represents a composite score calculated to evaluate the performance of the hospital branch. It is calculated using the following formula:
    score = (jumlah_pasien * 0.2) + (total_profit * 0.45) + (avg_review * 0.35)

    This dataset contains monthly data for Mulia Hospital across its different branches. 
    Each row represents data for a specific branch, recorded in a particular month and year. 
    The dataset includes various metrics related to patient numbers, reviews, financial performance, and a calculated performance score.

    Here are the descriptions of the columns in the dataset:
    - `branch_name`: The name of the hospital branch where the data was recorded. This helps identify which branch the data pertains to.
    - `month`: The month in which the data was collected. It is usually represented as a numeric value (e.g., 1 for January, 2 for February, etc.).
    - `year`: The year in which the data was recorded. This helps to identify the time period of the data.
    - `jumlah_pasien`: The total number of patients treated in the branch during the specified month and year.
    - `avg_review`: The average review score given by patients for their experience at the branch. This is typically on a scale (e.g., 1 to 5), where higher scores indicate better reviews.
    - `cogs`: Cost of Goods Sold. This refers to the direct costs attributable to the production of the services provided by the hospital, such as medical supplies and labor directly associated with patient care.
    - `total_revenue`: The total revenue generated by the branch during the specified month and year. This includes all income from patient services and other activities.
    - `total_profit`: The total profit made by the branch during the specified month and year. This is calculated as total revenue minus cogs.
    - `score`: This column represents a composite score calculated to evaluate the performance of the hospital branch. It is calculated using the following formula:
    score = (jumlah_pasien * 0.2) + (total_profit * 0.45) + (avg_review * 0.35)

    This dataset contains monthly data for Mulia Hospital across its different branches. 
    Each row represents data for a specific branch, recorded in a particular month and year. 
    The dataset includes various metrics related to patient numbers, reviews, financial performance, and a calculated performance score.

    Here are the descriptions of the columns in the dataset:
    - `branch_name`: The name of the hospital branch where the data was recorded. This helps identify which branch the data pertains to.
    - `month`: The month in which the data was collected. It is usually represented as a numeric value (e.g., 1 for January, 2 for February, etc.).
    - `year`: The year in which the data was recorded. This helps to identify the time period of the data.
    - `jumlah_pasien`: The total number of patients treated in the branch during the specified month and year.
    - `avg_review`: The average review score given by patients for their experience at the branch. This is typically on a scale (e.g., 1 to 5), where higher scores indicate better reviews.
    - `cogs`: Cost of Goods Sold. This refers to the direct costs attributable to the production of the services provided by the hospital, such as medical supplies and labor directly associated with patient care.
    - `total_revenue`: The total revenue generated by the branch during the specified month and year. This includes all income from patient services and other activities.
    - `total_profit`: The total profit made by the branch during the specified month and year. This is calculated as total revenue minus cogs.
    - `score`: This column represents a composite score calculated to evaluate the performance of the hospital branch. It is calculated using the following formula:

    - `branch_name`: The name of the hospital branch where the data was recorded. This helps identify which branch the data pertains to.
    - `month`: The month in which the data was collected. It is usually represented as a numeric value (e.g., 1 for January, 2 for February, etc.).
    - `year`: The year in which the data was recorded. This helps to identify the time period of the data.
    - `jumlah_pasien`: The total number of patients treated in the branch during the specified month and year.
    - `avg_review`: The average review score given by patients for their experience at the branch. This is typically on a scale (e.g., 1 to 5), where higher scores indicate better reviews.
    - `cogs`: Cost of Goods Sold. This refers to the direct costs attributable to the production of the services provided by the hospital, such as medical supplies and labor directly associated with patient care.
    - `total_revenue`: The total revenue generated by the branch during the specified month and year. This includes all income from patient services and other activities.
    - `total_profit`: The total profit made by the branch during the specified month and year. This is calculated as total revenue minus cogs.
    - `score`: This column represents a composite score calculated to evaluate the performance of the hospital branch. It is calculated using the following formula:
    score = (jumlah_pasien * 0.2) + (total_profit * 0.45) + (avg_review * 0.35)

This is the initial python function. Do not change the params. Given the context, use the right dataframes.
```python
# TODO import all the dependencies required
import pandas as pd

def analyze_data(dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze the data, using the provided dataframes (`dfs`).
    1. Prepare: Preprocessing and cleaning data if necessary
    2. Process: Manipulating data for analysis (grouping, filtering, aggregating, etc.)
    3. Analyze: Conducting the actual analysis (if the user asks to plot a chart you must save it as an image in temp_chart.png and not show the chart.)
    If the user requests to create a chart, utilize the Python matplotlib library to generate high-quality graphics that will be saved directly to a file.
    At the end, return a dictionary of:
    - type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot")
    - value (can be a string, a dataframe or the path of the plot, NOT a dictionary)
    Examples: 
        { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." }
        or
        { "type": "number", "value": 125 }
        or
        { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) }
        or
        { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }
    """
```

Take a deep breath and reason step-by-step. Act as a senior data analyst.
In the answer, you must never write the "technical" names of the tables.
Based on the last message in the conversation:
- return the updated analyze_data function wrapped within ```python ```
